# Customer Segmentation Analysis Project in R


**Introduction**

The Customer Segmentation Analysis project leverages R to analyze a comprehensive customer dataset, enabling the development of targeted marketing strategies by segmenting customers based on essential attributes. This initiative enhances customer relations and loyalty, significantly impacting marketing effectiveness and brand reputation.

**Data Description**

The dataset consists of over 15,000 records from an internal customer database, detailing age, gender, annual income, and spending scores. Extensive preprocessing included data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare the data for detailed analysis.

**Analysis and Insights**

The data exploration phase highlighted varied distributions across customer age, gender, income, and spending scores, with annual income and spending scores playing a key role in the segmentation process. Visualizations such as scatter plots and histograms were used to illustrate the relationships and distributions across these attributes.

**Model Descriptions**

K-Means clustering was chosen for its effectiveness in segmenting large datasets into meaningful groups. The number of clusters was optimized using the elbow method, which helped identify the most significant divisions within the customer base.

**Results**

The analysis successfully divided the customer base into four distinct segments, characterized by their unique spending and income traits. This segmentation has been instrumental in crafting targeted marketing initiatives, enhancing customer engagement, and improving overall business outcomes.
